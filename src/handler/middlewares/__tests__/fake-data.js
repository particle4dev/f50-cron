Services giant Accenture will lead the joint-effort by managing the project, integrating it into existing systems and providing cybersecurity consulting to further secure the platform.</p><p>TASE adds the platform will serve a &#x2018;one-stop-shop&#x2019; for all manners of securities lending activities that will also be able to support large volumes of securities transactions in quicker timeframes as well as &#x2018;operating in shorter-term positions&#x2019;. Beyond improving operational efficiency and speeds, TASE says the blockchain platform will also reduce costs significantly for custodians and their clients as well as the operator itself.</p><p>TASE chief executive Ittai Ben-Zeev added:</p><blockquote><p>&#x201C;The Blockchain technology will present a new level of safety for securities lending and will support growth for transactions based on this new platform.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p>The development of the blockchain platform will first see an initial proof of concept (PoC). Its success will see a wider deployment of the blockchain-based lending platform for the real-world.</p><p>Israel&#x2019;s only public stock exchange, the TASE is under the direct supervision of the Israel Securities Authority (ISA), the domestic capital markets authority. The exchange&#x2019;s embrace of blockchain technology comes despite a recent regulatory move by the ISA to <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/israel-regulator-threatens-ban-bitcoin-firms-stock-exchange/\">ban cryptocurrency firms from trading or listing</a> on the TASE.</p><p><em>TASE interior image from Shutterstock.</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>JP Morgan once again caused a bit of an upheaval within cryptocurrency circles last week - this time with the publication of their peer-to-peer (P2P) payments network <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/jp-morgan-files-patent-for-blockchain-powered-p2p-payments-between-banks\">patent application</a> based on distributed ledger technology, like blockchain.</p><p>Some crypto enthusiasts <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/8h55jj/jp_morgan_files_patent_for_blockchainpowered/?st=jh0cy5bo&amp;sh=8382db0b\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">branded</a> the move as <em>&#x201C;hypocrisy to the extreme.&#x201D;</em> The criticism is not unfounded but perhaps not accurate. The bank, and to a greater extent, their outspoken CEO, Jamie Dimon, has been responsible for a lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt surrounding Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole.</p><h2>&#x201C;Bitcoin is a fraud&#x201D;</h2><p>The Jamie Dimon/JP Morgan saga of 2017 is still fresh in the minds of crypto enthusiasts. It all started with Dimon&#x2019;s now-infamous words calling Bitcoin a &#x201C;<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/jamie-dimon-calls-bitcoin-fraud-despite-clear-conflict-of-interest\">fraud</a>&#x201D; in September 2017. Shortly after that, in a somewhat confusing move, JP Morgan <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/chase-bank-buys-bitcoin-even-as-jamie-dimon-rejects-it\">purchased</a> a chunk of Bitcoin.</p><p>Even more confusing was the fact that less than a week later, Jamie Dimon lashed out against Bitcoin, stating that governments would soon ban it. In the same breath, he fired shots at the industry as a whole, saying cryptocurrencies are &#x201C;<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ceo-of-jp-morgan-chase-warns-govts-will-ban-bitcoin-crypto-worth-nothing\">worth nothing</a>&#x201D;. Less than a month later he called Bitcoin investors &#x201C;<a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/jamie-dimon-breaks-one-day-silence-to-call-bitcoin-investors-stupid\">stupid</a>&#x201D;, adding that they <em>&#x201C;will pay the price for it one day&#x201D;</em>.</p><p>However, JP Morgan&#x2019;s strategies didn&#x2019;t always seem to line up with the opinions of their CEO, as in Nov. 2017 the bank announced that they planned to <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-jamie-dimon-goes-his-way-jpmorgan-goes-other-way\">trade Bitcoin futures</a> on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). In December 2017, a strategist at the bank had gone so far as to say that regulated futures markets give Bitcoin <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/jp-morgan-strategist-says-regulated-futures-markets-give-bitcoin-legitimacy\">legitimacy</a>.</p><p>By January 2018, Jamie Dimon himself had done a complete 180 on his &#x201C;Bitcoin-is-a-fraud&#x201D; comments and said he <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/jpmorgan-chase-ceo-jamie-dimon-regrets-saying-bitcoin-is-a-fraud-but-still-isnt-interested-in-it\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">regretted</a> making it. All this happened within the space of four months and cemented JP Morgan&#x2019;s perceived reputation - and Dimon&#x2019;s personal reputation - as the ultimate Bitcoin and cryptocurrency <em>&#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/what-jpmorgan-chase-ceo-jamie-dimon-has-said-about-bitcoin-2646132\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">villain</a>&#x201D;.</em> &#xA0;</p><h2>Criticism was never labeled against blockchain</h2><p>While their skepticism surrounding Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is clear, JP Morgan, and Jamie Dimon, never expressed any animosity towards blockchain&#x2019;s legitimacy. In fact, JP Morgan is one of the underlying technology&#x2019;s earliest supporters and testers.</p><p>As far back as 1999, the bank filed a <a href=\"http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PG01&amp;s1=20130317984&amp;OS=20130317984&amp;RS=20130317984\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">patent</a> for an alternative payments network. In 2016 they unveiled <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-looking-ethereum-blockchain-jpm/\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Juno and Quorum</a>, two separate blockchain-based projects. JP Morgan is also one of over 300 members that make up the <a href=\"https://entethalliance.org/members-2/\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA)</a>.</p><p>The bank has a strong record of support for blockchain itself and their latest patent application should come as no surprise. In fact, the bank first filed the patent - which aims to facilitate interbank payments using blockchain technology on <a href=\"http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;r=1&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PG01&amp;S1=20180121911.PGNR.&amp;OS=dn/20180121911&amp;RS=DN/20180121911\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">October 30, 2017</a>, a mere two weeks after Jamie Dimon labeled Bitcoin investors stupid.</p><h2>The surprise might come later</h2><p>The apparent surprise or hypocrisy stems from the fact that <em>Bitcoin, blockchain</em> and <em>cryptocurrency</em> are still being used as interchangeable concepts in mainstream media. This is not accurate, just as JP Morgan&#x2019;s filing for a patent based on distributed ledger technology does not mean they are now staunch Bitcoin supporters.</p><p>However, the surprise might come later. Blockchain has moved on from just being the technology that underpins Bitcoin and has potential use cases other than just as a basis for cryptocurrency networks, including the tracking of vaccines in healthcare, secure remote voting during elections, incorruptible and accurate record keeping of official government documents, to name a few.</p><p>Saying that, JP Morgan is specifically applying for a patent on a<em> &#x201C;method for processing network payments using a distributed ledger&#x201D;</em>. This begs the question; can you have a P2P payments network based on blockchain without utilizing a digital token in some shape or form to process such payments?</p><p>Some community members <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/8h55jj/jp_morgan_files_patent_for_blockchainpowered/?st=jh0a44bb&amp;sh=4452358a#bottom-comments\" rel=\"nofollow,noopener\" target=\"_blank\">don&#x2019;t believe</a> that you can, even arguing that the bank would be in direct competition with Ripple&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-cross-border-payments-pilot-financial-institutions-report-significant-time-cost-savings\">cross-border transfer platform</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&#x201C;It&apos;s not the competition part that is off... it&apos;s the fact that they are describing the exact thing Ripple is currently pushing into the market. There is no way this patent goes through, and if it does, prior art will protect Ripple as they have this working already. It&apos;s (as someone else stated) like filing a patent for an electric vehicle today.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><h2>How does Ripple work?</h2><p>Ripple connects banks around the world and enables them to offer real-time cross-border payment services to customers. Cross-border payments in the traditional sense require a number of intermediary companies to execute which means transactions can take up to four days to complete.</p><p>Ripple allows banks to sidestep these intermediaries with their transaction protocol, enabling them to execute transactions directly, and in doing so, cutting down costs and processing times. The transaction protocol includes a five-step process of payment initiation, pre-transaction validation, cryptographic hold of funds, settlement and confirmation.</p><p><img alt=\"HOW RIPPLE WORKS\" src=\"//cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/42cbcd8788433967b79df2ba839ff16b.png\" title=\"HOW RIPPLE WORKS\"></p><p>Messaging systems are used to coordinate information exchange between the originating and beneficiary banks and an interledger protocol (ILP) ledger is used to coordinate the actual movement of funds. The goal is to speed up processing times, increase end-to-end visibility, increase transaction approval rates and ultimately lower transaction costs.</p><h2>What are the similarities with JP Morgan&#x2019;s proposed blockchain payment network?</h2><p>The patent application describes a process of<em> &#x201C;Systems and methods for the application of distributed ledgers for network payments as financial exchange settlement and reconciliation.&#x201D;</em></p><p>It goes on to claim,<em> &#x201C;In one embodiment, a method for processing network payments using a distributed ledger may include: </em></p><ol><li><em>a payment originator initiating a payment instruction to a payment beneficiary; </em></li><li><em>a payment originator bank posting and committing the payment instruction to a distributed ledger on a P2P network; </em></li><li><em>the payment beneficiary bank posting and committing the payment instruction to the distributed ledger on a P2P network; and </em></li><li><em>the payment originator bank validating and processing the payment through a payment originator bank internal system and debiting an originator account.&#x201D;</em></li></ol><p><img alt=\"JP MORGAN BLOCKCHAIN PAYMENT NETWORK\" src=\"//cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/2760222a59410922f764d9056c0c74f6.png\" title=\"JP MORGAN BLOCKCHAIN PAYMENT NETWORK\"></p><p>JP Morgan&#x2019;s proposed system therefore depicts a payment protocol with direct communication or messaging between beneficiary and originator banks, used in conjunction with a reconciliatory distributed ledger blockchain.</p><p>In essence, this is a very similar system and process to that used by Ripple, basically describing an interbank messaging and reconciliation protocol based on distributed ledger technology in order to eliminate expensive intermediaries, speed up transaction time and extend the global remittance reach.</p><p>It would also seem then, that if JP Morgan is indeed planning to develop the system described in the patent, they will have to implement it with a cryptocurrency at its core, the very thing they have been trying to discredit for the last few months.</p><p>The ultimate question then becomes whether it is possible to be a strong supporter of blockchain on one hand, but an equally strong opponent of the validity and legitimacy of cryptocurrencies on the other.</p>",

The American investing tycoon, Wilson said, has not done his research.</p><h2>Why Bitcoin Has Value</h2><p>Speaking at the Consensus 2018 conference in New York City, Wilson said that the true value of the bitcoin ecosystem would accrue to the protocol itself and not the businesses that build on top if it.

He went on to say that they will not represent a good deal even years from now.</p><p>Wilson went on to say that he thought governments would attempt to control cryptocurrency and would enjoy some success, but said that they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to undo the work that has already been done, likening it to trying to &#x201C;put the genie back in the bottle&#x201D;.</p><h2>Fred Wilson&#x2019;s Open Letter to Warren Buffett</h2><figure><a href=\"https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fred-Wilson.jpg\"><img data-size=\"1280x720\" data-cfsrc=\"https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fred-Wilson-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"fred wilson\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" srcset=\"https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fred-Wilson-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fred-Wilson-300x169.jpg 300w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fred-Wilson-768x432.jpg 768w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fred-Wilson-640x360.jpg 640w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fred-Wilson-360x203.jpg 360w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fred-Wilson.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\"><noscript><img class=\"wp-image-87106\" data-size=\"1280x720\" src=\"https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fred-Wilson-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"fred wilson\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" srcset=\"https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fred-Wilson-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fred-Wilson-300x169.jpg 300w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fred-Wilson-768x432.jpg 768w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fred-Wilson-640x360.jpg 640w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fred-Wilson-360x203.jpg 360w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fred-Wilson.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></noscript></a><figcaption>Union Square Ventures founder Fred Wilson | Source: YouTube</figcaption></figure><p>Wilson was responding to billionaire Buffett&#x2019;s recent comments, made during the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting at the beginning of the month, when he described bitcoin as being &#x201C;rat poison squared&#x201D; and said that bitcoin &#x201C;is creating nothing&#x201D;.</p><p>His comments drew a lot of criticism, not only from blockchain entrepreneurs but from respected businessmen and venture capitalists like Wilson himself. However, those opinions are <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is-winkelvoss-dares-bill-gates-to-short-bitcoin/\">shared</a>, at least to some extent, by the likes of Bill Gates and most major banks.</p><p>Following the meeting, Wilson posted an open letter on his AVC blog, and he repeated his comments when speaking during the annual Consensus conference this week. He stated that Buffett dislikes bitcoin because of the lack of cash flow for the underlying networks. He hinted that Buffett&#x2019;s investment style is that of investing in businesses, and because bitcoin is decentralized there is no underlying business in which Buffett can invest. That, Wilson posits, is why Buffett has been put off by the idea.</p><p>Wilson did temper his comments with some words of caution, saying that he expected governments to have some success in rationalizing and, ultimately, regulating the industry but said that the ICO market is half-way to a new capital market.</p><p><em>Featured Image from Shutterstock</em></p>",

    "body": "<p>Coinbase&#x2019;s new venture capital fund has announced a strategic investment in Compound, a startup that is building money market accounts for cryptocurrency investors.</p><p>Compound is the first project to receive venture funding from Coinbase as part of the company&#x2019;s new efforts for fostering blockchain innovation. As CCN <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/coinbase-turns-early-seed-investor-with-new-venture-capital-fund/\">reported</a>, Coinbase announced the new venture fund to incubate early-stage startups in the exploding industry.</p><p>Coinbase&#x2019;s funding is part of a larger $8.2 million seed funding round, which pools other backers including Bain Capital Ventures,&#xA0;Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital, with participation from Transmedia Capital, Compound Ventures, Abstract Ventures, Danhua Capital.</p><p>While other coin and token projects have debated ways to generate interest or dividend income, Compound has run with the idea.&#xA0; In a blog <a href=\"https://medium.com/@saliloquy/money-markets-for-cryptoassets-dc02c57c305e\">update</a>,&#xA0; Salil Deshpande,&#xA0;Managing Director at Bain Capital Ventures, he states that current lending solutions for cryptoassets &#x201C;are not good enough: they are either centralized and have substantial counterpart risk, or require robust order books for each type of cryptoasset, which generally do not exist.&#x201D;</p><p>Compound&#x2019;s mission is to put cryptoassets to work that now &#x201C;sit idle on exchanges and in wallets, yielding no interest,&#x201D; according Founder Robert Leshner in a blog <a href=\"https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-raises-8-2-million-to-create-money-markets-for-crypto-assets-6dfa593f8e5e\">update</a> about the funding announcement.</p><p>Leshner continues:</p><blockquote><p>&#x201C;&#x2026;when Compound launches it&#x2019;s [sic] first money markets on the Ethereum blockchain, individuals, institutions and applications will earn interest on Ether, stablecoins and utility tokens, with complete liquidity&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;similar to the overnight rate for dollars and government currencies.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p>The core technology behind Compound is a decentralized blockchain infrastructure that is centered around a series of open-source smart contracts. As part of the smart contracts, the interest rates for each asset adjust dynamically in response to the borrowing demand for that asset. An algorithm makes these adjustments in real time, according to the project&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://compound.finance/documents/Compound.Whitepaper.v03-a457878fa6c97a53d81c275f867982f3.pdf?vsn=d\">whitepaper</a>.</p><figure><a href=\"https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/compound-site-shot.png\"><img data-size=\"1079x630\" data-cfsrc=\"https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/compound-site-shot-1024x598.png\" alt=\"coinbase\" width=\"1024\" height=\"598\" srcset=\"https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/compound-site-shot-1024x598.png 1024w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/compound-site-shot-300x175.png 300w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/compound-site-shot-768x448.png 768w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/compound-site-shot-640x374.png 640w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/compound-site-shot-360x210.png 360w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/compound-site-shot.png 1079w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><noscript><img class=\"wp-image-137196 size-large\" data-size=\"1079x630\" src=\"https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/compound-site-shot-1024x598.png\" alt=\"coinbase\" width=\"1024\" height=\"598\" srcset=\"https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/compound-site-shot-1024x598.png 1024w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/compound-site-shot-300x175.png 300w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/compound-site-shot-768x448.png 768w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/compound-site-shot-640x374.png 640w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/compound-site-shot-360x210.png 360w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/compound-site-shot.png 1079w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></noscript></a><figcaption>Source: Compound</figcaption></figure><p>Compound hopes to attract borrowers such as hedge funds, sophisticated speculators, and other Ethereum applications.</p><p>As Compound&#x2019;s technology aligns closely with Coinbase&#x2019;s entrenched status as a company that is revolutionizing traditional finance, it is no small wonder why it has received the firm&#x2019;s backing. The company&#x2019;s target market of institutional investors is in line with Coinbase&#x2019;s recent rolling out of a suite of tools for only these clients, as CCN <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/welcome-to-big-money-coinbase-rolls-out-sophisticated-suite-for-large-institutional-investors/\">reported</a> on May 15.</p><p>Compound&#x2019;s core technology also eases reporting, since each money market is transparent, auditable, and completely predictable. Coinbase itself has also worked hard on institutional-grade reporting as part of <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/coinbase-engages-with-regulators-about-becoming-a-licensed-bd-report/\">efforts</a> for becoming an SEC-regulated brokerage.</p><p><em>Featured Image from Shutterstock</em></p>",
